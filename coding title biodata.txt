            My name is <strong>Muhammad Akmal Thaqif bin Adli.</strong> I was born on 
            <em>May 13<sup>th</sup> 2004,</em> which makes me 20 years old today. Right now, I continue my study at <font color="blue"><i>UiTM Rembau</i></font> to finish my diploma of <font color="blue"><i>Information Management.</i></font> I'm a semester 5 student and this semester will be my last semester in <font color="blue"><i>UiTM Rembau</i></font>. At <font color="blue"><b>Rembau,</b></font> I stay at a rental house with my friends. We have a lot of spare time at the rental house because we only have classes for two days. Therefore, I spend my days doing what I think is fun since I like to spend my leisure time with my hobby. My hobby is playing video games. Currently, I play mobile games with my friends since it was so fun to play together. Other than that, I also love to play a single player game, especially a game with a genre of <b>survival horror.</b> A part from that, I also like to listening to music. Listening to a variety of music genre while jogging around the neighborhood is the best combination. On top of everything, life is good. I believe people should have a hobby to fill their leisure time.

He was introduced as one of the two [[player characters]] in the video game ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' (1998), alongside [[Claire Redfield]]. During the events of ''Resident Evil 2'', Leon is a rookie police officer who arrives in the doomed [[Raccoon City]] late for his first day on the job and is confronted by a [[Zombies in Resident Evil|zombie]] outbreak. 
                
                Leon is the protagonist of several ''Resident Evil'' games, [[novelizations]], and films and has also appeared in other game franchises, including ''[[Project X Zone]]'' and ''[[Dead by Daylight]]''. He appears in the CG [[animated films]] and in the animated miniseries. In later games, such as the remakes of [[Resident Evil 2 (2019 video game)|''Resident Evil 2'']] (2019) and [[Resident Evil 4 (2023 video game)|''Resident Evil 4'']] (2023), his features were based on Romanian model Eduard Badaluta. Several actors have portrayed the character, [[Paul Haddad]], [[Paul Mercier (actor)|Paul Mercier]], [[Matthew Mercer]], Nick Apostolides, and [[Toshiyuki Morikawa]] have provided Leon's voice for his video game and animated appearances, while [[Johann Urb]] and [[Avan Jogia]] have played him in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|live-action ''Resident Evil'' films]].
                
                [[Video game journalism|Video game publications]] have described Leon as among the most popular and iconic video game characters, and he ranks consistently as a fan favorite character of the franchise. Both his personality in ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' and his redesign in the remakes have been highly praised, which also further enhanced his [[sex appeal]].

                The biggest issue director Yasuhiro Seto of ''[[Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles]]'' faced as he went from early drafts to the finished scenario was how to show Leon in the game. Leon has starred in two ''Resident Evil'' films, ''Resident Evil 4'' and ''[[Resident Evil: Degeneration]]'', following his appearance in ''Resident Evil 2''. Instead of just reproducing ''Resident Evil 2'' word for word, they sought to reimagine Leon's first adventure while taking into consideration modern expectations, as the game was released more than ten years ago.<ref name=Yasuhiro>{{cite web|title=Yasuhiro Seto's "Talking Evil" Blog|url=https://www.projectumbrella.net/yasuhiro-setos-talking-evil-blog.html|date=April 24, 2009|access-date=June 6, 2012|website=Project Umbrella RE:Digest|archive-date=September 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210921104022/https://www.projectumbrella.net/yasuhiro-setos-talking-evil-blog.html|url-status=live}}</ref> With Leon, writer [[Sh≈çtar≈ç Suga]] has already written a script for ''Degeneration''.

An official artbook debunked the theory claiming Leon was an American immigrant of Italian descent. Further research throughout gaming media about Leon's personal life and ''Resident Evil'' promotional material led to the French movie ''[[L√©on: The Professional]]''. Natalie Portman's character Matilda whom [[Jean Reno]]'s title character has to protect is a parallel in both Sherry who appears in ''Resident Evil 2'' and ''Resident Evil 6''. ''Resident Evil 4'' brings more references to the movie like the Mathilda weapon and the "Professional" difficulty. In replays of ''Resident Evil 4'', Leon can instead wear an outfit that generated more confusion within the ''Resident Evil'' fandom about Leon's true nationality. Digital Trend praised Capcom for keeping vague about Leon's nationality.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/is-resident-evil-4-leon-s-kennedy-italian-investigation/|title=Is Resident Evil 4‚Äôs Leon S.
