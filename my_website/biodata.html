    best combination. On top of everything, life is good. I believe people should have a hobby to fill their leisure time.</b>

    <b>My goal is to get rich and buy a house and a car. I just want to have a good carrier that can make me rich. The reason
    why I want to get rich is to buy anything for my parents without checking my balance in my credit card. Once I have all the money,
    I want to get married with my love ones as I am fully prepared to build my own family. Those who read this, pray for my success as 
    I will pray for your success as well. :)</b>

    <b>My father is from Terengganu while my mother is from Selangor. Currently I live at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_Baru_Bangi"><font color="skyblue">Bandar Baru Bangi, Selangor.</font></a>
    My parents have 5 children as I am the fourth child. I have two older brothers, one elder sister and one younger sister.
    My siblings above me have already married which makes me and my younger sister the only children that did not got married yet.
    To be honest, it's kind of a pressure for me as I watched my older siblings have already make their own family, knowing the fact
    that I was next in line. I get rid of that thought as I need to build my carrier first before having a family of my own.</b>

    <b>I have lived for 20 years since I was born as I have experience quite a few events. Some happy and some tragic. My journey during
    my primary school and highschool is quite tough yet enjoyable at the same time. This is because, when I was at the primary school,
    I found it hard to make friends with my schoolmate as I live a bit far from the others. Moving to the highschool, I attented a boarding
    school as it was much more easier to bond with my schoolmate as we experience the same things together. In my opinion, highschool era was the best.
    After I finished my highschool, I attended some part time job before I continue my study in <a href="https://ms.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembau"><font color="skyblue"><b>Rembau.</b></font></a>
    It was quiete challenging as I entered the adulthood. I also went for the industrial training at <a href="https://azzahrah.my/"><font color="skyblue"><b>Hospital Islam Az-Zahrah.</b></font></a>
    Although I did not find it enjoyable, I do gain a lot of experience during my internship.</b>
